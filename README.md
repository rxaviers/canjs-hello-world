This project aims to be a guide on how to organize your [CanJS](http://canjs.com/) project. So, you can:

- Include external libraries in a version controlled way using Bower;
- Build production concatenated+minified JS and CSS files using node.js/gruntjs;

## Getting started

See the Hello World examples as they grow in complexity. Each directory holds a

- **plain-js**: The plain example.
- **amd**: When you need run-time dependency management for your app.
